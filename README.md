This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### There is a server backend that only runs locally on my cpu!

This means that you can't run the app outside of my computer. :(

# react-express-psql

This is a messaging project created by [jadilorenzo](https://github.com/jadilorenzo).<br/>
It uses a Postgres database backend to run alongside the react frontend.
